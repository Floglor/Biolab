A small proof of concept

This is a project I created for my resume. It's a small AI-driven proof of concept with zero to no input from a player. 
Please be aware that I highly recommend reviewing this as a solution inside Unity, but feel free to download a build if you want to. 

Controls - RMB to navigate around the map and Scroll to zoom in or out. 

Warning: the graphics are almost non-existing and extremely raw. It's not a complete game and even not an alpha. 
NOTE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT LET THIS GAME BE PLAYED FOR FAR TOO LONG ON A WEAK PC. CREATURES WILL SPAWN TO THE LIMIT AND THE PATHFINDER WILL BE HARD ON YOUR CPU.

There is a few main principles of this game that you should read before playing to understand what's happening:

 The game will start with some creatures spawned across the map. They have three needs - Hunger, Thirst, and Mating. They will work hard to meet them.

 There are two types of creatures. White consume green tiles which have limited supply and grow a little. 

 Black creatures can hunt down white ones. They breed with far less frequency. 
 
 When the hunt begins, herbivores will run from carnivores. When running, both creatures will drastically gain thirst.
 
 Creatures will mutate. Their speed will differ based on mutation value and their parents' speed.

The concept is very raw. In perfect circumstances, this will create a biosphere equilibrium, as this game aims to mimic the real nature by having needs and population.
